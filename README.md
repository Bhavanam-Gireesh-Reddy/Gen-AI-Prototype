## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

The application operates through a core `CareerCounselorAgent` that follows a two-step process:

1.  **Analysis Phase:**
    -   The user enters a career domain (e.g., "Quantum Computing").
    -   The agent uses a **LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)** chain, powered by the **Google Gemini** model, to analyze the domain.
    -   The AI's output is parsed and validated against a Pydantic `DomainAnalysis` model to structure the information.

2.  **Learning Path Generation:**
    -   The agent extracts the required skills from the most prominent emerging role identified in the analysis.
    -   Based on the user's selected learning style (e.g., 'visual'), a second LCEL chain generates a `LearningPath` object, outlining the curriculum.
    -   For each step in the curriculum, the agent performs a targeted search using the **YouTube and Google Search APIs** to find a relevant video or article link.
    -   The final, resource-filled analysis and learning path are displayed to the user.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### 1. Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8+
-   A **Google API Key**. You can get one from the [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey).
-   A **YouTube API Key**. You can get one from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials). Make sure the "YouTube Data API v3" is enabled for your project.

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bhavanam-Gireesh-Reddy/Gen-AI-Prototype.git
cd Gen-AI-Prototype
```

### 3. Set Up a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
```bash
# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Install Dependencies

Create a requirements.txt file with the following content:
```bash
streamlit
langchain-core
langchain-google-genai
pydantic
google-api-python-client
googlesearch-python
```
Then, install the packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Configure API Keys

This project uses Streamlit's secrets management. Create a file at ~/.streamlit/secrets.toml (or inside your project directory at .streamlit/secrets.toml) and add your API keys:
```bash
# .streamlit/secrets.toml

GOOGLE_API_KEY = "YOUR_GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY"
YOUTUBE_API_KEY = "YOUR_YOUTUBE_DATA_API_KEY"
```

### 6. Run the Application

Launch the Streamlit app with the following command:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Open your web browser and navigate to the local URL provided by Streamlit (usually http://localhost:8501).

## üí° Usage
Enter a career domain you are interested in (e.g., "AI in FinTech", "Bioinformatics", "Decentralized Finance").

Choose your preferred learning style from the dropdown (Visual, Reading, or Practical).

Click the "‚ú® Generate My Path" button.

Wait for the AI to perform the analysis and build your personalized plan.

Explore your career forecast and start learning!
